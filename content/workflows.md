# My Favorite Workflows

I've outlined below some of my favorite tools and workflows for researchers. These are the tools I wish had found earlier in my graduate student career. In choosing tools, I tend to prefer free, open, and open-source software or one-time purchases over subscription services. The workflows below reflect that preference. 

## Reference and PDF Manager 
I organize articles and their corresponding references using Zotero and Zotfile, following the advice laid out [here](https://www.nrel.colostate.edu/set-up-best-reference-manager/). Together, Zotero and Zotfile allow you to download academic articles, automatically rename them according to a set format, and store them in Dropbox (or some other cloud service) with just a few clicks. I save articles in a single folder within Dropbox and then use Zotero's tags and search function to find the article I need (rather than relying on a set folder structure).
