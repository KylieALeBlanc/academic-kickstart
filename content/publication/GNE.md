title = "Gather-Narrow-Extract: A Framework for Studying Local Policy Variation Using Web-Scraping and Natural Language Processing"
authors = ["Kylie L. Anglin"]
abstract = "Although students are fundamentally impacted by policies made at the school and district level, education researchers have traditionally faced severe data limitations in studying local policy variation. Administrative datasets capture only a fraction of the policy decisions districts make, and it can be expensive to collect more nuanced implementation data from teachers and leaders. Natural language processing and web-scraping techniques can help address these challenges by assisting researchers in locating and processing policy implementation documents located online. School district policies and practices are commonly documented in student and staff manuals, school improvement plans, and meeting minutes that are posted for the public. This paper introduces and end-to-end framework for collecting these sorts of policy documents and extracting structured policy data: the researcher gathers all potentially-relevant documents from district websites, narrows the text corpus to spans of interest using a text classifier, and then extracts specific policy data using additional NLP techniques. Using this framework, a researcher can describe variation in policy implementation at the local level, aggregated across state- or nation-wide populations even as policies evolve over time. "
